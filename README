Global Shortcut
=======

Because Qxt is no longer maintained, I make QxtGlobalShortcut runnable as standalone inside your Qt applications without all the Qxtlib (some modifications was made).
To integrate it in your application, simply follow the *main.cpp* file who demonstrate simply example. All files are self-explained.

Thank to the Qxt Team !
